						<h5>RESEARCH INTEREST</h5>
						<p>
							I am currently a senior engineer in the CX(Customer eXperience) team at Samsung SDS. I leverage my extensive HCI experience, quantitative analysis in particular, to develop systems that increase efficiency, productivity, and usability.
							Before joining Samsung SDS, I earned my Ph.D. in the Graduate School of Knowledge Service Engineering at KAIST in 2019, advised by <a href="http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?UichinLee">Uichin Lee</a>.
							My research interests span across various areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Behavioral Analysis. Specifically, I am interested in understanding, designing, and evaluating crowd-sourced services with mobile crowd-sensing technology.
						</p>

						<br>
						<h5>HOBBY</h5>
						<p>
							I am really interested in physical activities and I partake in several sports. 
							My favorites include weight training, swimming, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu- in which I have a blue belt. 
							I have a body-building trainer’s license which was approved in 2016 by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of South Korea, and I won third place in Sport Model competition ()division of AGE 30s) in WNGP Anyang in 2021.

								This paper proposes GoldenTime, a mobile app that promotes self-regulated usage behavior via system-driven proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives framed as gain or loss for behavioral reinforcement. 
								We conducted a large-scale user study (n = 210) to explore how our proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives influence users’ smartphone usage behaviors.

								<p>
								Vehicle dashboard cameras or dashcams, among other smart vehicle technologies, are increasingly attracting interest across the globe. 
								Furthermore, dashcam videos as objective witnesses are often shared to resolve various traffic incidents. 
								In this work, we aim to understand cross-national differences in motives and privacy concerns of dashcam video-sharing, 
								which are closely related to the factors that vary across countries, such as cultural values, traffic regulation, driving environments, and privacy perception.
								</p>
								<p>
								I was heavily involved in the entire study from the start (this work was extended from my work, which is publisehd in CHI2016).
								Specifically, I contributed to the analyzing the survey data using the statistical analysis and providing insightful discussion based on the findings as a corresponding author.

								What do you think of community safety? 
								In this study, we designed a community-sourced patrolling campaign in which community members would schedule their patrol times and routes, perform bike-based patrolling with video capturing and share the information using their smartphones. 
								We conducted a four-week field study (n=20) on a university campus to verify the campaign's feasibility and observe users' behavior.

								<p>
								In location-based social Q&A services, 
								people ask a question with a high expectation that local residents who have local knowledge will answer the question. 
								Besides, questions are classified by regions rather than topics, unlike existing topic-based Q&A services. 
								We analyzed a 12-month period Q&A dataset from Naver KiN "Here," a popular location-based social Q&A mobile app in South Korea, 
								in addition to a supplementary survey dataset obtained from 285 mobile users.
								</p>
								<p>
								This work is an extended version of my work, which was published at MobileHCI2014. 
								Unfortunately, the location-based mobile Q&A service was integrated into another Q&A service, 
								so you cannot use the mobile app now. 
								However, I am sure that this work still has excellent insights for designing other location-based services.

								We often see various traffic violations on the road while driving. 
								In this study, we consider community policing on the road with pervasive recording technologies. 
								We developed a mobile app so that drivers can easily capture and report various threats to traffic safety to the police via mobile apps. 
								Our two-week user study showed that the mobile app effectively supported community policing activities on the road.
								</p>
								<p>
								This work is one of my representative studies. 
								I was so proud of finding a good way to contribute to road safety. 
								On the other hand, I was so sorry for the people who received real traffic tickets by the reports in the field study. 
								I am still trying to figure out how to effectively and positively contribute to road safety with mobile crowd-sensing technologies.

								What if your parent knows your bad driving habits? 
								Bad driving behaviors are a major cause of traffic accidents, many of them resulting in fatalities. 
								Our study intends to encourage safe driving habits by increasing drivers' self-awareness about their driving habits, 
								as well as receiving supportive feedback on their driving behavior from a loved one as an intervention method. 
								We built an Android prototype app to deliver feedback for bad driving maneuvers to both drivers themselves 
								and to their corresponding supporters and conducted a field study evaluation.
								</p>
								<p>
								It was an honor to supervise the students (first and second authors) as a mentor in KSE652 class in Fall 2016. 
								As all the members drove every day, we knew some people had bad driving habits such as sudden braking or speeding, and it could be improved with loved one's concerns. 
								Surprisingly, we received a very high score in CHI2017 Extended Abstract review. 
								One of the reviewers gave us 5 (out of 5), and the average rating was higher than 4.

								Dashcams support the continuous recording of external views that provide evidence in case of unexpected traffic-related accidents and incidents. 
								Recently, the sharing of dashcam videos has gained significant traction for accident investigation and entertainment purposes. 
								Furthermore, there is a growing awareness that dashcam video sharing will significantly extend urban surveillance. 
								Our work aims to identify the major motives and concerns behind the sharing of dashcam videos for urban surveillance.
								</p>
								<p>
								This was my first paper at CHI, which is one of the greatest conferences in the HCI field.
								From this study, I could learn how to use mixed-method research (qualitative and quantitative methods) to analyze survey data.
								This work inspires me to have a great interest in understanding motives and privacy in mobile crowd-sensing.

								Uber and Airbnb, two well-known sharing economy services, are facing conflicts with traditional taxi and hotel companies 
								because these services have monetary benefits but are free from legacy regulations. 
								However, non-monetary-based sharing services, represented by Couchsurfing, Inc., are free from such conflict and still successful.
								We investigated the distinctive user participation motivation of non-monetary-based sharing services versus monetary-based ones.
								</p>
								<p>
								Ta-da! This is the most cited work among all the publications.
								The first, second, and third authors were my mentees in the KSE652 class in Fall 2015.
								This work is memorable for me because it was my first time to supervise graduate students and lead them to submit papers to a conference.

								In location-based social Q&A, the questions related to a local community (e.g., local services and places) are typically answered by local residents. 
								We wanted to deepen our understanding of the localness of knowledge sharing through investigating the topical and typological patterns related to the geographic characteristics, 
								geographic locality of user activities, and motivations of local knowledge sharing. 
								To this end, we analyzed a 12-month period Q&A dataset from Naver KiN "Here" and a supplementary survey dataset from 285 mobile users.
								</p>
								<p>
								This is my first research publication. 
								For this research, I had to do various work, such as crawling Q&A data and analyzing the data using data-mining techniques. 
								Besides, I had to design and conduct an online survey. 
								It could not be published without co-authors' support. Thank you, my heroes!

									There are many academic search engines such as Google Scholar and DBLP. 
									However, existing services are targeting global users, so it is hard to find researchers in my university. 
									KAIST Scholar shows collaboration networks across researchers based on search results 
									so that people can easily understand who has worked with whom for any specific research at KAIST.

									Then, I built a simple website so that KAIST students can see whether laundry machines in a dormitory are available or not. 
									I wanted to open the website in public, but it was not allowed to use the sensor I made in a dormitory due to fire hazards :(

									2011. No web framework fully supported Python3 in 2011. Besides, no python web framework was designed to work like PHP (for example, <? ... ?>).
									We knew many developers hated that way, but we thought it would be interesting if it is possible with Python3. 
									Thus, two of my friends and I decided to make a new python web framework, even supporting Python 3 from scratch. 
									After opening our framework, Pylatte, as an opensource, I sent an email to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido Van Rossum</a>, who is a creator of Python, to receive any feedback from him. 
									Surprisingly, he replied to me and wrote a post introducing Pylatte on his Google+. 
									However, we have not updated Pylatte for a long time and are not willing to update anymore because there are many good python3-based web frameworks. 
									Instead, I am enjoying developing web sites using Flask and studying django :)
